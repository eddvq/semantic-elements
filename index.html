      <h2>What are Semantic Elements?</h2>
      <p>HTML is the markup language for documents on the web browser. The language makes use of tags that serve different purposes on the page. <strong>Semantic-elements tell developers and browsers what the element means.</strong> For example, the article tag, contains information that is self contained and can stand alone in the page. A developer from the tag alone, is able to infer the type of content that would be contained within the tag. For the machine, it helps with accessibility by helping it interpret the content that exists on the page. There are other tags that are non-semantic that do not give information about the content it contains to neither user nor machine so it could potentially leave room for confusion or interpretation because they lack specificity and context.</p>

      <h3>The Page Visualized</h3>
      <p>The web may seem abstract however to help you visualize how these tags come to work please refer to the diagram below:</p>
